Giterary began atop a mountain, when someone said "We should write a book." Despite investigating many alternatives, no software solution solved this particular problem in a way that made sense. And thus a project was born.

The bulk of Giterary was created in the span of about 6 months, starting summer 2012. It was inspired initially by the [Wigit codebase](http://el-tramo.be/software/wigit/) for its minimal solution and its few required dependencies.

If you're interested, an article exists for Giterary on its [[CONVENTIONS|programming decisions and conventions]], plus [[LICENSE|licensing]] information, if that interests you.
